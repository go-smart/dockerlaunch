   contain the root `toctree` directive.

dockerlaunch
============

This daemon allows a specific, limited set of commands to be issued from
within a prepared container (e.g. `Glossia <https://github.com/go-smart/glossia>`_)
to trigger interaction with the Docker server.

Communication with the container is via a Unix domain socket, by default
located at ``/var/run/dockerlaunch/dockerlaunch.sock``. This is mounted
into the master container.
